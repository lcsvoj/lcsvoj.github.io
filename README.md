## Description:
This portfolio website is my final project for Harvard's CS50: https://lcsvoj.github.io/
The website is composed of four static HTML pages, each featuring an animated and visually appealing header and footer.
The style was implemented using Bootstrap, and some JavaScript features were added to enhance the user experience.

The website is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes, from smartphones, through tablets and notebooks, to large desktop monitors.

## Pages:

1. **index.html**
    - The landing page of the website.
    - Styled using `index.css`.
    - A JavaScript animation, implemented in `index.js`, provides a dynamic and attention-capturing continuous background animation.

2. **aboutme.html**
    - This page provides personal and professional information about me.
    - Styled using `aboutme.css`.

3. **projects.html**
    - This page showcases the projects I've worked on.
    - Styled using `projects.css`.

4. **skills.html**
    - This page presents my skills and certifications.
    - Styled using `skills.css`.
    - A JavaScript animation in `skills.js` highlights the ability to zoom in on each certificate in the certificates gallery.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Future Enhancements:
I plan to continually update the website with new projects and skills.
I'm also considering adding a blog section to share insights and learnings from my professional journey.
